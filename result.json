          "body": "Took these pouches to the beach for a few days in a row and have had them submerged under the ocean water for long periods of time. No moisture got in the case, not even condensation which is surprising. The touch screen works perfectly as well, but it wonâ€™t work underwater as water creates a barrier for capacitive touch screens whereas air doesnâ€™t. If you try to record underwater, record above of it first then bring the phone underwater. Face recognition generally worked as well as what the Iphone could do, but didnâ€™t rely on it too much.One minor issue which Iâ€™ve seen other people comment on is that the side buttons are masked under the opaque colors of the pouch and makes itâ€™s a bit clunky to figure out which buttons youâ€™re pressing. Itâ€™s not the greatest design, but doesnâ€™t impact the pouch functionality.",

We had gone kayaking in the ocean and needless to say one of us had flipped the kayak trying to get back on from the sandbar (also thank goodness for shallow water bc this doesn't float). When this happened I hadn't realized my phone had gone into rhe water. My phone was underwater about 4 feet deep for over 5 minutes and it kept my phone in pristine condition. The only concern was that it didn't float but that's not part of this particular product. Super happy with purchase!",

          "body": "Â I don't swim, but I love watching life under the ocean.  I snorkel at the beach, not out at the reefs.  I first tested this case by putting a paper towel in it and weighting it down in the sink at home for about 1/2 hour.  No seepage. None in my husband's case either. On our Florida trip, I used it with my Iphone 12 in it and my husband on land with his Iphone 6.  Mine took beautiful clear photos underwater, and initially I was having no problems with the touch screen in the case.  It worked well when out of the water.  In fact, the case and neck cord are particularly helpful when you are taking the glass bottom boat ride at John Pennakamp State Park, Key Largo, FL because you can't drop your phone in the water when using it, and it is protected from spray when you are at the bow of the boat going out to where the viewing area is.  I easily added my driver's license and credit card to the case (making sure they were below the camera lens) and my mind was safely at ease that my valuables were protected.  One difficulty is that- when you are actually in the water at a beach, and the sun is out, the reflection makes it hard to view the phone screen selections (even without the waterproof case)+ the added water drops on the outside of the case.  My phone got warmer, as I was in the water for about 45 minutes each state park we visited, and the case started \"fogging\" inside, as the water was cool-furthering the difficulty of seeing the phone screen clearly while you are trying to take photos either in or out of the water.  When I was taking photos under the water, I couldn't clearly see the phone screen due to the fogging and found later that many of my underwater photos somehow went to video...and the videos were very short; almost \"snaps\" of the activity I was trying to capture.  Because of the wave activity, and standing in the water using the snorkel instead of floating (because I was afraid of drifting out over my head), I was buffeted about + my feet in the bottom silt would cloud the water as I was off balance.  So when I saw a school of fish, I just tried, without focusing, to keep rapidly hitting the shutter button to capture as much as I could of the action below me.  Obviously, sometimes I wasn't hitting the shutter, but either sliding to video or whatever.  Quite a few of my intended to be video videos had the notation \"unsupported\" when I loaded them to my pc at home.  I must have blindly hit something else???  Very disappointing.  Some of the intended still photos came out \"EA-xxxx\".  All of this must be operator error, as the touch and slide worked beautifully through the case when dry on the outside and taking photos out of the water environment.  I did have a great time using the case, and took videos and stills that I never could have taken without this case, so I would recommend it....just be aware of what could happen in the hands of someone like me.  I don't use face recognition.  When the camera was warm, it was difficult immediately removing the I-phone from the case without danger of splitting the case seams near the opening, but in a few minutes the problem dissipated as the phone cooled and the fogginess left the case.  I am posting a still shot of some type of lobster with a forked tail which ran across my foot and then hid under a rock, Bahia Honda State Park, Big Pine Key, FL and a video of fish at Fort Zach State Park in Key West, FL.  I had silted up the water with my feet, so not an issue with the case.  The fish at Bahia Honda around the beach tend to be brown, while the ones farther south at Fort Zach beach in Key West were colorful and only a couple of yards out.  The birds were taken using the case on dry land at John Pennakamp.",
